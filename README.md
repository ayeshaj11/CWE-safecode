# CWE-safecode

This project is one that me and my partner Anne Belenko did for our internship at Permanence AI. 
We wanted to test different classifiers and LLMs to see which performs better in figuring out good vs bad code. 
This was also a way to encourage safer, and better code. 
Here are our slides to describe the timeline and project in full.

* Keep in mind that if you want to run this code you will need to use your own API Key!
Thank you!
